        Tosca, you may not have heard from us in a while! A database error meant a bunch of members haven't been receiving our usual emails. It's all fixed now, but we're so sorry!
        <a href="http://www.getup.org.au/2020-monthly-survey">Here's a video of Big Ted talking about ABC funding cuts in our cheeky new video to make up for it!</a>

<p>{NAME|Friend},</p>
<p>Even Big Ted thinks 2020 hasbeen huge for the ABC.</p>
<p>Local and national reporters worked tirelessly for months as bushfires raged across the country.<sup>1</sup> The ABC stepped in to help kids learn during lockdown.<sup>2</sup> And then of course came the cuts...staff losing jobs and programmes axed or reduced.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>
  But GetUp members have been there keeping up the drumbeat and ensuring that the protection of the ABC remains on the national agenda.
</p>
<p>
  Because we know one thing for sure: if everyone who relied on the ABC stood up for it, its enemies wouldn't have a leg to stand on.
</p>
<p>
  And who better to rally community support than Big Ted? Recently, GetUp staff member Chandi met with the PlaySchool legend to chat about the fate of the ABC.

      Watch the video and share it with at least five people to keep up the pressure to protect our ABC.

<p>
  Why share it with friends and family? Because we know the coming months won't be easy for the ABC.
</p>
<p>
  With the threat of more cuts looming in the October budget, a hostile report commissioned by Morrison,4 and the Murdoch Press levelling more malicious attacks on our public broadcaster, GetUp members are working tirelessly to convince politicians on both sides of Parliament to protect our ABC from further cuts.
</p>
<p>
  But to have the best chance at saving our National Broadcaster we need as many of our like-minded neighbours, friends and family members to get on board.
